<p>TLDR: I made an app, <a href="https://github.com/asimpson/VDCAssistant-killer/releases">VDCAssistant-Killer</a>, to restart the process that manages the Facetime camera on your Mac.</p>
<p>Anyone who uses a Cinema Display with their Macbook has undoubtedly noticed that occasionally the Cinema Display Facetime camera will not be available for use in Hangouts/Zoom/Facetime call. The only fix was to restart the machine which usually made me late (and is a terrible solution in 2017). </p>
<p>Since <a href="https://adamsimpson.net/writing/be-a-good-video-call-citizen">I&#39;m on video calls quite a bit</a> this quickly started to drive me batty. I jumped into a google deep dive and found out the culprit was the process that manages the Facetime cameras on a Mac, VDCAssistant. </p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ever have your Cinema Display Facetime camera stop working? <code>sudo killall VDCAssistant</code> should get it back ðŸ˜“</p>&mdash; Adam Simpson (@a_simpson) <a href="https://twitter.com/a_simpson/status/796074967196639233">November 8, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p>This command worked fine for anyone comfortable with the command line, but what about folks who would rather have a GUI to do this? So I made <a href="https://github.com/asimpson/VDCAssistant-killer/releases">VDCAssistant-Killer</a> a menubar app that executes the exact shell command to restart the VDCAssistant  process for you. You shouldn&#39;t have to restart the computer or even the video call program, the assistant should automatically restart and make all connected cameras available to you immediately.</p>
<p>A few other notes: </p>
<ul>
<li>The app is all Swift.</li>
<li>It&#39;s incredibly easy to piece together a basic app with storyboards and some googling.</li>
<li>The actually shell command piece uses <a href="https://github.com/asimpson/VDCAssistant-killer/blob/master/FaceTime%20Killer/Killer.swift#L13">AppleScript APIs to pop up the password dialog</a>.</li>
<li>Emoji make great <a href="https://github.com/asimpson/VDCAssistant-killer/blob/master/FaceTime%20Killer/MenuController.swift#L26">stand-in icons</a></li>
</ul>
