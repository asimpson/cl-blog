<p>When you remove friction from a process or task, all the factors change. This seems obvious, but it&#39;s fundamental to understanding the world as it currently is. Polygon has a <a href="http://www.polygon.com/2017/2/21/14683942/pewdiepie-controversy-youtube-drama">post</a> up about the rash of &quot;Youtuber burnouts&quot; lately. The conclusion of the article stuck out to me (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>YouTube has a <em>speed and quantity problem, and it affects all aspects of the business</em>. If you are a content creator, take a little time with controversial stuff. It really is fun to make things, but irreverent, boundary-breaking stuff is high-risk/high-reward. Donâ€™t just spit it out: run things by friends and people not in the business. Test the tone before you go live. Sleep on it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Youtube is entertainment without traditional support mechanisms (i.e. friction). It&#39;s relentless and there are no structures in place to push back at all. I think this lack of friction is at the root of the majority of problems in tech. Things move quickly and because of that speed safeguards and checks haven&#39;t been instantiated yet. Not everything that pushes back is bad, that push-back can be life-saving.</p>
