When I was in junior high I attended a basketball camp. The camp moto for the week went something like: "There's always more one can do, always someone working harder than you".

At the time I thought this meant Michael Jordan was working harder than me (he was\!), but that I was right up there cause I was at camp, duh\!

Go work.

As the youths say, 'nough said.
