Speaking of [cultivation and passion](http://adamsimpson.net/writing/create-passion), Jeremy Keith wrote up a [great post](http://adactio.com/journal/5634/) on how to convince one's boss or client to adopt new web standards or methods.

> I do sometimes wonder whether we use the big bad client or the big bad boss as a crutch. “Oh, I’d love to try out this technique, but the client/boss would never go for it. Something something IE6.” Maybe we’re not giving them enough credit. Given the right argument, they might just listen to reason.

Go *work* on getting the right arguments for your specific client or boss, go *cultivate* a metric-ton of data to overwhelm whoever is holding back progress. No one is going to reach out and whack your boss or client with a "Web Standards Genius" stick for you, do the whacking yourself (figuratively, I do not endorse or condone violence against one's superiors, peers, or underlings). If after all that effort you're still not getting anywhere, then follow Mr. Keith's other piece of advice:
