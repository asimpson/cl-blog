<p>A <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3389-your-lifes-work">post</a> from <a href="http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/">David Heinemeier Hansson</a> over at <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3389-your-lifes-work">37 Signals</a> on settling into your work for the long term. This is something I've been thinking about  lately, largely because I've found a place at <a href="http://seesparkbox.com/">Sparkbox</a> that is such a fantastic place to work.</p>
