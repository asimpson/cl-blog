<p>I've been behind my <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:asimpson/">pinboard</a> unread queue for a few days and consequently have been missing the truth pouring out of <a href="http://www.twitter.com/benedictevans">Benedict Evans</a>.</p>

<p>His last <em>three</em> pieces are right on the money regarding mobile, and the web versus native apps.</p>

<p>Starting with <a href="http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/5/14/mobile-first">Mobile First</a>, he says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[...]the smartphone itself is an internet platform in a way that a PC was not. On a PC the web browser was the internet platform, but on a smartphone it's the entire device and the browser is turned from 'the internet' to one icon, just a phone calls turned from the purpose of the device to just one icon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then in <a href="http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/5/14/apps-versus-the-web">Apps versus the web</a> he finishes the piece by saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In either of these cases - whether you have an app and a website or just a website, you should presume that your customers will engage with you only on mobile.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And finally his last piece <a href="http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/5/17/the-future-is-mobile-and-apps-except-that-it-isnt">The future is mobile and apps, except that it isn't</a> he writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So the mobile experience needs to be complete. That might, paradoxically, mean that your total experience might need to be edited, to fit, but it's dangerous to pick a subset of your offer and put just that on mobile - it might be your only touch point. Conversely, <strong>one could argue</strong> that in some cases it's the desktop experience that should be a subset of the mobile one.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Complete</h2>

<p>The mobile experience needs to be complete, and that experience can be just a website, or just an app, or both. Regardless it needs to be complete. Complete is the operative word that binds these thoughts together. <a href="http://adamsimpson.net/writing/web-performance-and-facebooks-instant-articles">As we saw last week</a>, complete includes performance, especially performance on mobile.</p>
