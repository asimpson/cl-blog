I've been behind my [pinboard](https://pinboard.in/u:asimpson/) unread queue for a few days and consequently have been missing the truth pouring out of [Benedict Evans](http://www.twitter.com/benedictevans).

His last *three* pieces are right on the money regarding mobile, and the web versus native apps.

Starting with [Mobile First](http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/5/14/mobile-first), he says:

> \[...\]the smartphone itself is an internet platform in a way that a PC was not. On a PC the web browser was the internet platform, but on a smartphone it's the entire device and the browser is turned from 'the internet' to one icon, just a phone calls turned from the purpose of the device to just one icon.

Then in [Apps versus the web](http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/5/14/apps-versus-the-web) he finishes the piece by saying:

> In either of these cases - whether you have an app and a website or just a website, you should presume that your customers will engage with you only on mobile.

And finally his last piece [The future is mobile and apps, except that it isn't](http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/5/17/the-future-is-mobile-and-apps-except-that-it-isnt) he writes:

> So the mobile experience needs to be complete. That might, paradoxically, mean that your total experience might need to be edited, to fit, but it's dangerous to pick a subset of your offer and put just that on mobile - it might be your only touch point. Conversely, **one could argue** that in some cases it's the desktop experience that should be a subset of the mobile one.

## Complete

The mobile experience needs to be complete, and that experience can be just a website, or just an app, or both. Regardless it needs to be complete. Complete is the operative word that binds these thoughts together. [As we saw last week](http://adamsimpson.net/writing/web-performance-and-facebooks-instant-articles), complete includes performance, especially performance on mobile.
