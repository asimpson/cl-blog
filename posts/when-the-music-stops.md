Dave Winer [wrote a great post](http://scripting.com/stories/2012/08/16/privatizingAndSocializing.html) last week; he describes what happens when a piece of web software (i.e. Tumblr, Wordpress, etc) disappears. I decided to link to his post because I think it relates to my own [Plaintext](http://adamsimpson.net/plaintext-and-markdown-a-primer) and [Blogs, Data, and Social Networks](http://adamsimpson.net/blogs-data-and-social-networks) posts. Ultimately we are each responsible for our own data, or as Winer writes:

> I'm writing this \[â€¦\] to the users to wise up and also to stop being such children. If you feel there's value in your writing, then treat it like it has value. If you depend on strangers to pay your rent, you have to know that isn't going to work, long-term.

Start owning.
