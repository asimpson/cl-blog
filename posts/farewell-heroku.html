<p>I've migrated my apps off <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> and won't be using the service for personal apps going forward. Why? Let me back up a bit and explain what was so great about Heroku.</p>

<h2>Haiku? Ha-who?</h2>

<p>Heroku is a "hosting as a service" company. They try to take away the pain of deploying and managing web applications. They actually do this quite well, it's a great service. The "secret sauce" that made Heroku so good was it's free pricing tier. The free tier essentially allowed a single web or a single "worker" process to run 24/7. There was enough processing power to run apps or processes for a small number of users, perfect for apps like my <a href="/writing/iphone-checker-with-capybara-and-twilio">six plus checker</a> or <a href="http://ytrss.co">youtuberss app</a>.</p>

<p>If apps grew popular enough they would hit processing limits and I could go in and scale the app up to meet demand. Scaling an app also meant that I was no longer in the free tier and would begin paying Heroku for the additional resources. It really was an ideal setup (from my perspective as a developer).</p>

<h2>Sadness</h2>

<p>Sadly, Heroku <a href="https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2015/5/7/new-dyno-types-public-beta">announced a few months ago</a> a pretty big shift in their pricing. The free tier would no longer run 24/7 as a single process:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every app using free dynos can include not just a free web, but also one free worker, and free usage of heroku run and Heroku Scheduler. Free dynos can run up to <em>eighteen hours a day, but have to ‚Äúsleep‚Äù for at least the remaining six</em>. That‚Äôs eighteen hours each of serving traffic, running a background worker, and scheduled processes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I totally get they are trying to offer <em>more</em> of their platform in "demo mode" but I think it's the wrong move. To be clear, I'm not griping about a free lunch going away. I'm griping because the new pricing:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is harder to understand and manage. Seriously, I'm supposed to monitor my app in 18 hour increments?</li>
<li>Doesn't incentivize developers to try out new apps that could potentially become paying applications. </li>
</ol>

<p>Re: #2, The very impressive <a href="http://emojitracker.com">emojitracker</a> <a href="https://medium.com/@mroth/how-i-built-emojitracker-179cfd8238ac">was built on Heroku's platform</a>. Matthew Rothenberg, the project's developer, recounts how Heroku let him easily scale to meet demand:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I did this manually. That first evening I needed a break from intense computer usage all day, so I actually spent the evening in a bar across the street from my apartment with some friends, having a drink while passively monitoring these charts on some iPhones sitting on the table. Whenever it looked like something was spiking, I used the Nezumi Heroku client to scale up instances from my phone directly. I didn‚Äôt even have to put down my drink!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is awesome. It illustrates the ideal scenario: no money up front to try something out and a natural path to scaling it up if it takes off. Simple, it was.</p>

<h2>Where to now?</h2>

<p>I've now finished moving my node apps over to <a href="https://chunkhost.com/r/46012">Chunkhost</a>. With Chunkhost I get 1GB of RAM for under $5/month by paying yearly and via bitcoin (I use <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/join/526d7fc9d296a258e800005c">Coinbase</a> to purchase and manage Bitcoins). In comparison, Digital Ocean offers 512MB of RAM for $5/month. With the extra overhead from Chunkhost, I can easily host multiple apps on the same box. Plus, I've found that the two node apps I have running are both only using ~50MB of RAM!</p>

<h2>Sysadmin</h2>

<p>Yes, with Chunkhost I have to play as sysadmin and keep the VPS running. However I'm in total agreement with this <a href="http://www.marco.org/2014/03/27/web-hosting-for-app-developers">quote from Marco Arment</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Modern Linux server administration is much easier than you think. If you can write a halfway decent app, you can manage a Linux VPS in your sleep.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He's exactly right, managing a VPS isn't beyond the abilities of anyone who can write an app and put it on Heroku. I've found <a href="http://www.ansible.com/get-started">Ansible</a> + <a href="http://bitbucket.org">Bitbucket private repos</a> + <a href="http://pm2.keymetrics.io">PM2</a> a great deployment and management combo; one that I'll write more about later. It took some effort to set up, but now I can launch new apps in minutes.</p>

<p>Heroku's new pricing has forced me to branch out and figure out how to host, manage, and deploy my apps. Perhaps the pricing change wasn't <em>all</em> bad after all.</p>
