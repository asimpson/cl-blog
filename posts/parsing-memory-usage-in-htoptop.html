<p>I've been trying to figure out how much memory a node app is using on my VPS, and output from <code>top</code> or <code>htop</code> is fairly overwhelming. In searching around I found <a href="http://mugurel.sumanariu.ro/linux/the-difference-among-virt-res-and-shr-in-top-output/"> Mugurel Sumanariu's post</a> clearly explaining each column related to memory usage.</p>

<p>The column I should be paying attention to is <code>RES</code>, which</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[..] stands for the resident size, which is an accurate representation of how much actual physical memory a process is consuming. (This also corresponds directly to the %MEM column.)</p>
</blockquote>
