<p>I was happily (I had just started obviously) browsing Twitter today when I saw this tweet from the esteemed <a href="http://www.wilfred.me.uk">Wilfred Hughes</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">git-worktree allows you to have multiple branches checked out simultaneously! <a href="<https://t.co/R3ExhMNf7E>"><a href="https://t.co/R3ExhMNf7E">https://t.co/R3ExhMNf7E</a></a></p>&mdash; Wilfred Hughes (@<sub>wilfredh</sub>) <a href="<https://twitter.com/_wilfredh/status/937827498196381697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw>">December 4, 2017</a></blockquote>

<p>Huh? What is <code>git-worktree</code>? A quick Google landed me on <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree">the documentation</a> for <code>git-worktree</code>. The ;TLDR of <code>git-worktree</code> is that it breaks time and space and lets a user check out multiple branches <em>at the same time</em>. No more stash-checkout-stash-pop dance between branches and fixes! The <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree#_examples">example</a> in the documentation is really really good (except for the boss part, that&#39;s usually played by my short-attention span).</p>

<p>After reading the documentation, my next thought was &quot;Does <a href="https://magit.vc">magit</a> support this?&quot; Yep, <a href="https://github.com/magit/magit/blob/94980fed2b87a2194c325702d1b70a58ca5738b7/lisp/magit-worktree.el">since last year</a>! Let me take this moment to rave like a maniac, magit is amazing and everyone should be using it as their primary git client (irregardless of Emacs usage for text-editing). As the <a href="https://emacsair.me/2016/05/19/magit-2.7/">documentation explains</a>, to get worktree information in the standard magit status buffer the <code>magit-status-sections-hook</code> needs to be updated like so:</p>
<p><code>(add-hook &#39;magit-status-sections-hook &#39;magit-insert-worktrees)</code>.</p>
<p>The actions for creating or checking out a worktree are (hiding) in the branches (<code>b</code>) popup. I don&#39;t know why I&#39;ve never noticed them until now!</p>
<p><code>git-worktree</code> is another example of <code>git</code> not standing still. It&#39;s exceptional (even under-appreciated) software that continues to improve and that&#39;s something that doesn&#39;t get enough praise and attention.</p>
