Twitter's recent API changes and announcements seem to be purposefully obtuse. I don't know why they can't just make an announcement telling third-party, client developers to "kick rocks" and turn off the API? It would be easier, their brand probably wouldn't suffer as much. Maybe they think that any publicity is good publicity? Or maybe Twitter has been incompetent from the start (the fail whale was fun right?), and we forget how they really didn't contribute any meaningful features or innovations to their own platform, users did.

Don't get me wrong, [I'm not ganging up on Twitter (wouldn't want to hurt a companies feelings right?)](http://dashes.com/anil/2012/08/what-twitters-api-announcement-could-have-said.html) or anything. I'm not upset with Twitter for changing how their platform works, it is their platform after all. I'm just amazed at the lack of *clear*, direct communication.

So, here is a list of other writers who have attempted to unravel what Twitter's recent announcements actually mean. Enjoy.

  - Marco Arment wrote a [great breakdown](http://www.marco.org/2012/08/16/twitter-api-changes).
  - Ben Brooks piggybacked off Marco's post with [his own](http://brooksreview.net/2012/08/twitter-bullshit/).
  - Matthew Panzarino also did a solid job in [his post](http://thenextweb.com/twitter/2012/08/17/twitter-4/).
  - And finally, Gruber had some [fantastic verbiage to express his frustration](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/08/16/twitter-drop-dead).
