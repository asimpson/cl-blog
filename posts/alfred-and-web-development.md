Fellow web developer and all around awesome guy [Adam Clark](https://twitter.com/avclark), put together [two](http://thegentlymad.com/2012/09/30/simplify-your-dev-workflow-with-alfred/) [fantastic](http://thegentlymad.com/2012/10/04/easy-wordpress-database-management-with-alfred/) screencasts on his blog which demonstrate the power of [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) and how to enhance common front-end workflows. Inspired by his post, I thought I would start sharing some tips on how I use Alfred throughout the day.

I use Alfred 57.4 times a day. It's awesome, so awesome that it has replaced Spotlight on my Mac. I have two custom searches that relate directly to front-end development, a [Mozilla Developer Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) custom search, and a [Can I use](http://caniuse.com/) custom search. These shortcuts allow me to:

1.  Invoke Alfred
2.  Type "cani" or "mdn" followed by a space.
3.  Type my query, i.e. "background-size"
4.  Hit Enter and see the resulting documentation or caniuse page for the query.

Here are the actual URLs as I set them up in Alfred: `https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/search?q={query}` `http://caniuse.com/#search={query}`

This is a simple thing to setup, and it probably only saves a few seconds, but it feels friction-less which is the whole point of using Alfred.
