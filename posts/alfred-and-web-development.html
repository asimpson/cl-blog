<p>Fellow web developer and all around awesome guy <a href="https://twitter.com/avclark">Adam Clark</a>, put together <a href="http://thegentlymad.com/2012/09/30/simplify-your-dev-workflow-with-alfred/">two</a> <a href="http://thegentlymad.com/2012/10/04/easy-wordpress-database-management-with-alfred/">fantastic</a> screencasts on his blog which demonstrate the power of <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> and how to enhance common front-end workflows. Inspired by his post, I thought I would start sharing some tips on how I use Alfred throughout the day.</p>

<p>I use Alfred 57.4 times a day. It's awesome, so awesome that it has replaced Spotlight on my Mac. I have two custom searches that relate directly to front-end development, a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla Developer Documentation</a> custom search, and a <a href="http://caniuse.com/">Can I use</a> custom search. These shortcuts allow me to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Invoke Alfred</li>
<li>Type "cani" or "mdn" followed by a space.</li>
<li>Type my query, i.e. "background-size"</li>
<li>Hit Enter and see the resulting documentation or caniuse page for the query.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here are the actual URLs as I set them up in Alfred:
<code>https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/search?q={query}</code>
<code>http://caniuse.com/#search={query}</code></p>

<p>This is a simple thing to setup, and it probably only saves a few seconds, but it feels friction-less which is the whole point of using Alfred.</p>
