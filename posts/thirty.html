<p>Today I turn 30. For the last couple birthdays I&#39;ve wanted to do a &quot;X things I&#39;ve learned&quot; post like the incomparable <a href="http://esbueno.noahstokes.com/post/155722679971/forty">Mr. Noah Stokes</a> but I kept forgetting. Not this year! This past year has been exceptionally full. In my mind, turning 30 has always been a milestone. Turns out (<em>spoilers!</em>) the day is just a that, a marker; all the exciting stuff is ahead and behind. I&#39;m so thankful I get to navigate it all with a great partner in crime/life/adventure, my wife Christi üòç.</p>
