<p>I&#39;ve been playing around with SQLite recently and I&#39;ve stumbled across a few things I want to remember, so I&#39;m putting them here.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The <a href="https://sqlite.org/cli.html">SQLite CLI</a> is pretty darn good. Just remember to read in the SQLite DB file first, e.g. <code>.open /path/to/file</code>. After that, any SQLite command is valid. Specific CLI commands are prefixed with a period.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Set the the <code>.mode</code> to <code>line</code> to visually grep the results.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To see the <code>rowid</code> include it specifically in <code>SELECT</code> statements on the CLI, e.g. <code>SELECT rowid,* from table</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Delete an entry by <code>rowid</code> like this, <code>DELETE FROM table WHERE rowid=7;</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>When structuring a database, create a unique ID for each row like so:
<code>create table foo (id INTEGER AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY UNIQUE NOT NULL, other_column TEXT)</code>. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That&#39;s all I got for now. I&#39;ll drop more tips in this post as I come across them.</p>
