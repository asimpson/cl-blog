I'm slowly working my way through the latest edition of [The Manual Vol. \#3](http://alwaysreadthemanual.com). I just finished [Tiffani Jones Brown's](http://tiffanijonesbrown.com) excellent essay on Practicing Passion. This quote really stuck with me,

> Instead of asking "what will make me feel passion?" we should ask, "how can I make passion happen?" The answer is to cultivate a way of living and working that makes passion more likely.

I love this, it doesn't leave room for me to have any excuses. Cultivation takes effort, perseverance, hard work, and purpose. Time to [get to work](http://adamsimpson.net/writing/someone-is-working-harder-than-you), the passion will show up if I do.
