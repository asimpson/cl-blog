<p>Tweetbot for Mac entered Beta a few weeks ago, and also cut off new users from trying out the Beta to comply with new <a href="/maybe-you-should-its-not-you-move-on">API changes from Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>I love Tweetbot, and the Mac client is no exception. However I ran into a snag when I tried to set up the Tweetbot Beta on my new MacBook Air. The app kept redirecting me to the <a href="tapbots.com/blog/news/tweetbot-for-mac-beta-sort-of">Tweetbot Beta  blog post</a>. Now to be fair, I think if I had used the Migration Assistant built into OS X I wouldn't have run into this issue. However I had already decided to "start fresh" on this new machine and only bring things over from my old MacBook Pro when needed. After spending a couple minutes Googling around for a solution, I gave up and reverted to my trusty, stand-by <a href="http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific">Twitterific</a>.</p>

<p>After a couple days of this I got the bug again to see if I could get Tweetbot Beta up and running on my new machine. New comments on the Tweetbot Beta blog post revealed the solution. Check out these <a href="http://tapbots.com/blog/news/tweetbot-for-mac-beta-sort-of#comment-3609">two</a> <a href="http://tapbots.com/blog/news/tweetbot-for-mac-beta-sort-of#comment-3605">answers</a>, Tweetbot Beta is now happily running on my new MacBook Air. To move Tweetbot Beta to a new machine copy the <strong>Tweetbot Keychain item, Application Support folder, and Container folder</strong> to your new Mac and you should be good to go.</p>
