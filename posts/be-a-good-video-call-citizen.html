<p>Ah the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYu_bGbZiiQ">video call</a>. Usually fraught with 5 minutes of &quot;Can you hear me now?&quot;, distorted faces, or <a href="https://twitter.com/JOE_co_uk/status/840165524038377472">your two children</a> in the background. I&#39;ve been in my fair share of video calls and I thought I&#39;d share a few tricks that help limit my contributions to the chaos.</p>
<h2 id="be-a-few-minutes-early-">Be a few minutes early.</h2>
<p>If you&#39;re there early you can get any hiccups (technical or otherwise) out of the way before the meeting actually starts. No fancy technical trick here.</p>
<h2 id="keep-your-workspace-neat">Keep your workspace neat</h2>
<p>Again, not a technical solution but a practical one. Limit the distractions you may present by having a tidy workspace. Pay special attention to what&#39;s behind you before you get on a call. Everyone&#39;s been laughing at <a href="https://medium.com/@benthompson/breaking-down-the-father-on-bbc-being-interrupted-by-his-children-9840cdc8857b#.akw0oxqef">poor Professor Kelly</a> recently but notice that he clearly spent some time before the call trying to make his background look good.</p>
<h2 id="use-a-cough-button-https-en-wiktionary-org-wiki-cough_button-aka-push-to-talk-">Use a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cough_button">cough button</a> (aka push-to-talk)</h2>
<p>I love the <a href="http://mizage.com/shush/">Shush app</a>. It works at the system level to mute or unmute your microphone and binds that action to a hotkey. Shush is fantastic because you don&#39;t need to remember where each video service stashes its mute button. The ability to quickly toggle mute is a super power that goes a long way towards minimizing any distractions you may create while on the call.</p>
<p>There you have it, my top three tips for video calls. Do you have any other tips? Let me know about them on <a href="https://twitter.com/a_simpson">twitter</a> and I&#39;ll list them below.</p>

I&#39;d add:<br>• Go to a quiet env if possible. If not, liberally use mute<br>• Use headphones (echoing is no good)</p>&mdash; Aaron Bushnell (@aaronbushnell) <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronbushnell/status/842754802190864384">March 17, 2017</a></blockquote>
