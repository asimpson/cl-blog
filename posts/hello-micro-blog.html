<p>I&#39;ve started posting my normal blog feed <em>and</em> a new micro feed to <a href="https://micro.blog/simpson">https://micro.blog/simpson</a>. My motivation for integrating with <a href="https://micro.blog/">micro.blog</a> is that it feels like the right approach for the &quot;open web&quot;.</p>
<p>It did take me awhile to understand the core concepts of micro.blog. The description on the iOS App Store is illuminating:</p>
<p><img src="https://adamsimpson.net/images/micro-blog-description.jpg" alt="Instead of trying to be a full social network, Micro.blog is a thin layer that glues the open web together, making it more useful. Micro.blog adds discovery and conversations on top of previously unconnected blog posts."></p>
<p>Brent Simmons (of <a href="http://inessential.com/">inessential.com</a>) had a <a href="http://inessential.com/2018/02/01/why_micro_blog_is_not_another_app_net">good post today</a> summarizing what makes micro.blog different from app.net or other social networks: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>And so everyone who follows me on Micro.blog sees my blog posts, and I see theirs. Simple.</p>
<p>And anyone who wants to could just read my blog in an RSS reader instead. All good, all open.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Micro.blog is simply a layer on top of existing RSS/JSON feeds; its simplicity echoes the simplicity of podcasting. </p>
<p>So hop on board! Follow me over at <a href="https://micro.blog/simpson">micro.blog/simpson</a> or subscribe directly to my new <a href="https://adamsimpson.net/micro/feed.json">micro feed</a>. </p>
