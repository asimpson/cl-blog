<p>I got my gigantic iPhone 6+ last weekend, and not via the online Apple Store where my order had been sitting for a couple weeks and wasn't going to ship until Nov. 5th. Instead I got a friendly text message the minute the phone was available at my local Apple Store. With a few great tools it was incredibly easy to set this system up.</p>

<p>TL;DR: I set up a small Heroku app that uses <a href="https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara">Capybara</a> to check Apple's website for availability and sends a text to my phone using the <a href="https://www.twilio.com">Twilio service</a>.</p>

<p>The entire process was pretty simple once I figured out a few Heroku oddities. The app hinges on the fact that Apple provides a "Check Availability" link during the ordering process. This link pops open a modal that take your zip code and checks nearby Apple stores for your product.</p>

<p>All I had to tell Capybara to do was visit the URL, click the check availability button, and enter my zip code. After that I loop through the store list and check the status message. If the phone is available I send myself a text with the store name, phone model, and link.</p>

<p>The toughest part of this project was figuring out how to tell Heroku where the <a href="http://phantomjs.org">Phantomjs</a> executable was located. Capybara uses Phantomjs behind the scenes and without it the whole thing wouldn't work. I initially tried to use <a href="https://github.com/stomita/heroku-buildpack-phantomjs">the Phantomjs build pack</a> but a weird thing with Heroku is that declaring a build pack seemingly removes the path for the Ruby executable. I then discovered the awesome <a href="https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi">multi build pack</a> tool. Once I created my <code>.buildpack</code> document I just had to tell Heroku to load the Phantomjs build pack <em>and</em> the Ruby build pack like this:</p>

<p><code>https://github.com/stomita/heroku-buildpack-phantomjs.git 
https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-ruby</code></p>

<p>The last piece of the app uses <a href="https://github.com/tomykaira/clockwork">clockwork</a> to kick off the scrape every 10 minutes. Clockwork is incredibly easy to setup and use. Specify the command in the <code>Procfile</code> and Heroku will understand exactly what to do.</p>
