<p>John Gruber wrote down his <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2015/05/facebook_instant_articles">initial thoughts</a> on <a href="http://instantarticles.fb.com/">Facebook's Instant Articles</a>. This portion regarding performance stood out:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m intrigued by the emphasis on speed. Not only is native mobile code winning for app development, but with things like Instant Articles, native is making the browser-based web look like a relic even just for publishing articles. If I’m right about that, it might pose a problem even for my overwhelmingly-text work at Daring Fireball. Daring Fireball pages load fast, but the pages I link to often don’t. I worry that the inherent slowness of the web and ill-considered trend toward over-produced web design is going to start hurting traffic to DF.</p>

<p>Maybe I can't see past my web developer bias, but I don't believe this is a death knell for the "open web." I think this <em>is</em> a wake-up call; there is no reason that Instant Articles should have such a speed advantage over a webpage.</p>

<p>Crafting a high-performing web experience for mobile is not easy, but it's not so impossibly hard that Instant Articles is the only solution. With Instant Articles, Facebook is saving publishers from themselves - notice the lack of advertising, over-the-top branding, or massive image slideshows. Instant Articles isn't faster because native beats the web. It's faster because disciplined, curated content wins over content shoved between 1MB of advertisements.</p>
