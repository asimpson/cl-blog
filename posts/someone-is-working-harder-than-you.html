<p>When I was in junior high I attended a basketball camp. The camp moto for the week went something like: "There's always more one can do, always someone working harder than you".</p>

<p>At the time I thought this meant Michael Jordan was working harder than me (he was!), but that I was right up there cause I was at camp, duh!</p>

  <p>Few people in history that we call creatives today read books or took courses on creativity. Instead they apprenticed with masters in a craft and worked with them. They did the grunt work until they had the skills needed to do more sophisticated work. They learned how to develop ideas and deliver finished work by working. There is no other way.</p>
