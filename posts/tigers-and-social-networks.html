<p>Charlie Pratt <a href="http://charliepratt.com/the-crowd-is-a-hungry-tiger/">published a post</a> today giving his take on current  happenings with both Twitter and Facebook. One company that has a history of ignoring any outside feedback, and one that he leaves out of his post, is Apple. While not a social network (R.I.P. Ping), Apple still sells multiple products to a massive, global consumer base. The difference between Apple and Twitbook is that Apple makes money from their consumers, something Twitter and Facebook are currently trying to put together.</p>

<p>Mr. Pratt goes on to observe:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As we watch Facebook and Twitter peak, one canâ€™t help but notice that they suddenly seem incredibly vulnerable to the whim of the crowd. Crowds are finicky[...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This only happens when you try to turn your consumer base, your crowd, into the product your selling.</p>

<p>Tigers don't like being sold, feeling captive, or turned into anything other than tigers.</p>
