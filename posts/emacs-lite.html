<p>I really dig Emacs. I think it&#39;s a one-of-kind computing experience. However, it&#39;s defaults are pretty rough and some of my favorites aspects of Emacs are third party packages. </p>
<p>I wondered if I could cram the &quot;awesome Emacs&quot; experience into 200 lines of configuration or less. <a href="https://github.com/asimpson/dotfiles/blob/master/emacs/emacs-lite.org">Turns out I could</a>. I only included what I consider (as someone who writes JS most days) &quot;essential&quot;. I didn&#39;t re-bind any keys except for <code>M-x</code> and that has the same function with an <a href="https://adamsimpson.net/writing/helm-to-ivy">upgraded interface</a>. I didn&#39;t include <code>evil-mode</code> (Vim emulation) either, introducing Emacs <em>and</em> Vim keybinds to someone is a suicide mission.</p>
<p>To use this config copy and paste the config snippet <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-File.html">into one of three config file locations</a> (sooooo Emacs): </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Emacs looks for your init file using the filenames ~/.emacs, ~/.emacs.el, or ~/.emacs.d/init.el</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then boot up Emacs (I&#39;m assuming you <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">already have it installed</a>), there will be a bit of waiting the first time as packages are installed for you.</p>
