<p>&quot;Diminishing modes&quot; in Emacs is a popular topic. It took me a while to understand the basic (and simple) rules around how to customize the display of the various mode names.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-modes">What are modes</h2>
<p>Modes in Emacs come in two flavors, major and minor modes. The <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Modes.html#Modes">Emacs manual</a> explains modes like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Emacs contains many editing modes that alter its basic behavior in useful ways.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Major modes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] provide specialized facilities for working on a particular file type [...] Major modes are mutually exclusive; each buffer has one and only one major mode at any time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Minor modes are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] optional features which you can turn on or off, not necessarily specific to a type of file or buffer. [...] Minor modes are independent of one another, and of the selected major mode.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="customize-the-mode-line">Customize the mode line</h2>
<p>Modes are great, yet they <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ModeLine">fill up the mode line</a>. I only really want to know about a handful of minor modes and the major mode. On top of that I don&#39;t like how some modes name themselves (e.g. all caps, too long, etc.). Changing the display or completely hiding a mode is different for major and minor modes. </p>
<h3 id="changing-minor-mode-names">Changing minor mode names</h3>
<p>Minor mode names are stored in a list variable called <code>minor-mode-alist</code>. You can customize that directly or use the fantastic package <a href="https://github.com/myrjola/diminish.el">diminish</a> as a wrapper around that functionality, like so:</p>
<p><code>(diminish &#39;flyspell &quot;spell&quot;)</code></p>
<h3 id="changing-major-mode-names">Changing major mode names</h3>
<p>Major mode names are not stored in a simple list variable. Yet, fear not! In reading the source of the diminish package, I stumbled <a href="https://github.com/myrjola/diminish.el/blob/master/diminish.el#L98">across this comment</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To diminish a major mode, (setq mode-name &quot;whatever&quot;) in the mode hook.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The variable <code>mode-name</code> couldn&#39;t be correct could it? Yes, yes it is. Here&#39;s an example of changing the mode name for the default <code>elisp-mode</code>:</p>
<p><code>(add-hook &#39;emacs-lisp-mode-hook (λ () (setq mode-name &quot;λ&quot;)))</code></p>
<p>Now you have all the tools at your disposal to change every mode&#39;s name in your mode line.</p>
