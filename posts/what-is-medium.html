<p>Manton Reece <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/08/startup-life-and-medium.html">in a post about Medium</a> wondered:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it a blogging tool? Sort of. Is it a social network? Not exactly.</p>

<p>I've found Medium incredibly useful for browsing a community's current thoughts and ideas. For instance, I love browsing the <a href="http://medium.com/tag/react">React tag</a> on Medium. It's filled with various posts about build tools, upcoming libraries, and thought pieces that I would never have found via RSS or Twitter.</p>

    It's been interesting to watch the <a href="https://twitter.com/reactjs">@reactjs</a> community adopt <a href="https://twitter.com/Medium">@Medium</a> as its "official" space to share ideas. <a href="https://t.co/7ZDJkkUocK">https://t.co/7ZDJkkUocK</a>

<p>Regardless of what Medium intends to be, they at least seem to have stumbled upon something interesting with tags (from my perspective). I'm curious to see how Medium continues to evolve.</p>
