<p><a href="https://twitter.com/BillSimmons">Bill Simmons'</a> latest piece <a href="https://theringer.com/pat-riley-gets-what-he-wants-undeniables-bill-simmons-4064cf607e42">on Pat Riley</a> is full of great Riley stories. One particular moment where Riley talks to Kevin Garnett really resonated with me (italics mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It happened to everyone. <em>You won’t truly know how outstanding you are, Riley promised him, until you’re surrounded by elite teammates who make you better.</em> He told stories about Magic’s Lakers teams, how special they were, how many battles they fought, how those postseasons bonded them for life. There was a higher level of basketball. It was out there. You wouldn’t understand until you’ve experienced it. And until you’ve lost it, too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We all need a team. On the <em>right</em> team we can go higher and be better than we ever thought we could.</p>

<p>To put it another way, we can only go so far alone.</p>
