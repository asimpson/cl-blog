<p>Currently, I have the cheapest <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&amp;docId=1000750701&amp;tag=googhydr-20&amp;hvadid=19552942650&amp;hvpos=1t1&amp;hvexid=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=488712776137896327&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;ref=pd_sl_9h7vyrl94n_e">Kindle</a> you can buy and I love it. I love it for reasons entirely different from my iPad. I love this Kindle cause it's super cheap and durable, and I never worry about its battery life or wether it's getting smashed in a bag when I travel.</p>

<p>I also love this Kindle for reading. I set up my <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> account to send me a digest of my Unread list every weekend, perfect for traveling, the pool, or even the beach â€“ you know, places the iPad shouldn't and can't go. The Kindle feature in Instapaper got me excited about other possibilities for reading web stuffs on my Kindle.</p>

<p>The first thing I stumbled upon shortly after setting up my Instapaper to Kindle connection was <a href="http://readlists.com">Readlists</a>. Readlists are brought to you by the same folks behind <a href="http://www.readability.com">Readability</a>. Readlists allows you to cobble together a list of articles from all over the web that they then compile into a Kindle digest. Rad!</p>

<p>After I discovered Readlists, I started finding <a href="http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/">several</a> <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html">fantastic</a> guides or books on JavaScript and Javascript best practices. Prominent members of the developer community are releasing these materials for free via Github or personal sites. I wanted to convert these excellent resources into documents on my Kindle. It was then that I discovered another fantastic resource from the Readability folks.</p>

<p>Readability released a <a href="http://www.readability.com/bookmarklets/">simple bookmarklet</a> that takes whatever page you're viewing in your browser and sends it to your Kindle. Problem solved! I now have a couple Kindle "books" that are sourced from the web, how awesome is that? Try it out for yourself and start utilizing the incredible resources out there.</p>
