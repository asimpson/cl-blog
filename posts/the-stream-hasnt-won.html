<p><a href="https://twitter.com/h0d3r">Hossein Derakhshan</a> wrote a <a href="https://medium.com/matter/the-web-we-have-to-save-2eb1fe15a426">fascinating piece over on Medium</a> that speaks about the web and his relation to it before and after his time in an Iranian prison. He outlines how the web as he knew it has disappeared and been replaced by "The Stream", or social media. His post is beautifully written and I highly recommend reading it. However, I disagree with some of his conclusions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I miss when people took time to be exposed to different opinions, and bothered to read more than a paragraph or 140 characters. I miss the days when I could write something on my own blog, publish on my own domain, without taking an equal time to promote it on numerous social networks; when nobody cared about likes and reshares.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nothing in this statement has gone away! The rise of social networks does not mean "the blog" or "the web" is in decline. "The Stream" hasn't won, I'm not convinced there's even a fight.</p>
