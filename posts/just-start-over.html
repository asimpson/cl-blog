<p>I love when designers write about their experience and process in designing a product.</p>

<p>Recently, <a href="http://dewith.com/2012/an-android-design-process/">Sebastiaan De With wrote a post</a> about his experience designing the <a href="http://doubletwist.com/alarmclock/">doubleTwist Alarm Clock</a>, an Android Clock app made by <a href="http://www.doubletwist.com/">doubleTwist</a>. I found myself nodding my head at this paragraph in his write up:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>During the process, I threw away a ton of designs and simply started over. I also touched on this being an important part of the design process in <a href="http://design.org/blog/interview-doubletwist-alarm-ui-designer-sebastiaan-de">the interview I gave on design.org</a>: when you feel like what you’re working on really needs a little bit extra, you have to realize that — even though you spent so much time on them — your designs are just pixels, and you can probably simply do better. Throw it out. Kill your baby. Start over. It’s made this app what it is today.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Starting over is a skill, and it's something I need to get better at.</p>
