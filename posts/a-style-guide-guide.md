Thanks to [@behoff](http://twitter.com/behoff) for [tweeting](http://twitter.com/behoff/status/226298234467930112) out [Elyse Holladay's blog post](http://www.elyseholladay.com/2012/07/16/style-guide-guide.html) about a guide for style guides.

The [post](http://www.elyseholladay.com/2012/07/16/style-guide-guide.html) is a fantastic read, and is chock full of good information. I then clicked over to see what else Ms. Holladay had written and found her [Hello World?](http://www.elyseholladay.com/2012/07/10/hello-world.html) post. It really resonated with my own reasons for starting this blog, especially this bit:

> I realized two things have stopped me: the feeling of inadequacy that leads to the fear of not starting, and the need to get it perfect first.

I struggle with the same mindset. I've found the best way to get over it, is to just ship. So, congrats Ms. Holladay on shipping, and congrats on the blog, it's awesome.
