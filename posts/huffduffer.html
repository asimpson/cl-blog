<p>I <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=Columbus,+OH&amp;daddr=Dayton,+OH&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=39.87075,-83.596344&amp;spn=0.60499,1.277161&amp;sll=39.982951,-82.990829&amp;sspn=0.603995,1.277161&amp;geocode=FVjCYQId9okN-ylx3pC5wYk4iDEztbHP-GYy5A%3BFWSsXgIdiVb7-ikDFN2u1YBAiDHkTA7ykuNApg&amp;mra=ls&amp;t=m&amp;z=10">have quite the commute to Sparkbox</a>, as such I listen to a lot of podcasts (usually via <a href="http://vemedio.com/products/instacast3">Instacast</a> on my iPhone).</p>

<p>My one pain point with this setup was when someone would recommend a specific episode of a podcast I didn't subscribe to. In order for me to listen to that episode, I would have to either download the MP3 and send it over to my phone via iTunes, stream it via Safari on my phone, or subscribe to the whole podcast in Instacast. None of those options are very convenient.</p>
