<p>I recently received my invite to <a href="https://www.simple.com/">Simple</a>, a new banking service that has taken the design and development communities by storm with the promise of intelligently designed banking apps and interfaces. Now, I&#39;m still waiting for my card to come, so I can&#39;t comment on the service itself. But, during the account set-up process, I was struck by how &quot;right&quot; it all felt, I took some screenshots as I went through to share.</p>
<p>Once you fill in your personal info and are approved for an account, you are taken to a page to set up a username and pass<em>phrase</em>. Yes, you read that correctly, not a password, a pass<em>phrase</em>. Simple claims a passphrase is easier to remember and improves the security of the account.</p>
<p>Once your passphrase and username are set up, Simple moves you to the next stage of the process, as pictured below: <img src="/images/simple-1.png" alt="download the simple app"></p>
<p>I elected to have a SMS sent to my iPhone to download the Simple app, sure enough in a few seconds there it was. I left the browser window open and proceeded to install the app which had me pick a 4 digit PIN as part of its setup.</p>
<p>Once I selected my PIN, the app presented the various user agreements and banking terms with a signature box to sign with my finger. After signing the box and poking around the app a bit more, I looked up at my computer screen and saw that the Simple page had changed to this: <img src="/images/simple-2.png" alt="signature complete"></p>
<p>Slick! The app had sent my signature to the page! In doing so, Simple infused a little bit of magic into a typically mundane sign-up process. The other key point of this process is that it ensures the focal point of the service, the Simple app, is set up and ready to go on every customer&#39;s phone.</p>
<p>I&#39;m excited to get my Simple card and start using the service, I hope every other bank in the world is paying attention, these little details matter!</p>
