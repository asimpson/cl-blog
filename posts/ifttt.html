<p>I love <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a>. IFTTT is one of those awesome services that I desperately wished had a business plan.</p>

<p>Here are a few of my favorite <a href="https://ifttt.com/wtf">IFTTT recipes</a>.</p>

<h3>App.net to Twitter</h3>

<p>A few weeks ago I made the decision to give <a href="https://alpha.app.net/a_simpson/">ADN</a> another try, largely because ADN offers a RSS feed of my posts, something Twitter thought was too complicated. So I decided to funnel my <em>original</em> posts through ADN and then post them to Twitter. IFTTT facilities all of this with ease.</p>

<h3>Post to App.net from Day One</h3>

<p>I love <a href="http://dayoneapp.com/">Day One</a>, however it doesn't support posting to ADN. I set up an IFTTT recipe that works off an email from Day One and posts it ADN. This recipe also gets bonus points for working in conjunction with the above ADN To Twitter Recipe.</p>

<h3>Camera Roll to Flickr</h3>

<p>This recipe is only possible through the new, delightful <a href="https://ifttt.com/mobile">IFTTT iOS app</a>. Whenever a new photo is taken, IFTTT uploads the photo to my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> account. This recipe serves the second purpose of offloading my Camera Roll backups from iCloud to Flickr.</p>

<h3>Feature Request</h3>

<p>I do wish IFTTT had one additional feature, Feed actions. I would love to have a personal feed, ala <a href="http://www.adamsimpson.net/huffduffer">Huffduffer</a>, into which IFTTT would dump any data from the various IFTTT triggers. A Feed action would technically allow basic looping when combined with the Feed trigger, which would be super useful and interesting.</p>
