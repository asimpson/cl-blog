[Three years](/writing/a-new-adventure). I'll be honest it snuck up on me.

Working with these [immensely talented people every day](http://www.seesparkbox.com/team) is such a privilege and has made me a better developer. I'm so proud of this team and what we've done together. I'm stoked for the adventures to come.
