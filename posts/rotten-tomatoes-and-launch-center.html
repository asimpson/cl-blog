<p>I appreciate <a href="http://rottentomatoes.com">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, I don&#39;t always agree with the ratings, but I like how they can add to an argument or conversation about a movie.</p>
<p>I hate the Rotten Tomatoes experience on an iPhone. It starts with this horrible app pop-up: <img src="/images/rotten-tomatoes-nag.png" alt="Rotten Tomatoes Nag"></p>
<p>Then it nags you to add the site to your homescreen, my home screen is meticulously planned out and I don&#39;t have the room for non-apps, so Rotten Tomatoes can go kick rocks.</p>
<p>A month or so ago I decided to do something about these things that bug me about Rotten Tomatoes. I spent an hour or two poking around the <a href="http://developer.rottentomatoes.com">API</a> and cobbled together <a href="https://github.com/asimpson/Diet-Rotten-Tomatoes">Diet Rotten Tomatoes</a>. It&#39;s a quick, lightweight way to get a movie&#39;s ratings, a full-size movie poster (click the thumbnail), and a link to the movie on Rotten Tomatoes.</p>
<p>I also added a way to search using <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com">Alfred</a> or <a href="http://appcubby.com/launch-center/">Launch Center Pro</a>. Simple append your search term to the URL like <code>#die hard</code> and it&#39;ll fire off a search as the page loads.</p>
<p>Hopefully you find it useful.</p>
