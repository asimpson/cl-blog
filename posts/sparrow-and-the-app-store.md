[David Barnard writes up](http://appcubby.com/blog/the-sparrow-problem/) his take on why [Sparrow](http://sparrowmailapp.com/) sold out. I found the end of his post fascinating:

> The age of selling software to users at a fixed, one-time price is coming to an end. It’s just not sustainable at the absurdly low prices users have come to expect. Sure, independent developers may scrap it out one app at a time, and some may even do quite well and be the exception to the rule, but I don’t think Sparrow would have sold-out if the team — and their investors — believed they could build a substantially profitable company on their own. The gold rush is well and truly over.

We are witnessing so many changes on the web and in the mobile industry. Software pricing and sustainability is just another item on a long list of things that are evolving.
