[Chris Bowler](http://chrisbowler.com/) jots down some fantastic advice in his [latest post](http://chrisbowler.com/journal/overcoming-project-guilt) (emphasis mine).

> But my purpose here is to simply encourage those with families. **Please do not spend your time endlessly comparing your accomplishments or progress** with those who have no family. Your setting yourself up for guilt at best, and resenting your family at worst.

I do not have any kids yet but I think this advice applies to everyone, especially those working on the web. I've been slowly learning that I cannot continue to compare myself to other people in my industry - it's counterproductive.
