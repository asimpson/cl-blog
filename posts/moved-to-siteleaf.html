<p>I've moved this blog from Jekyll on Heroku to <a href="http://www.siteleaf.com/">Siteleaf</a> on S3. I did this for a couple reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>Siteleaf gives me more control without having to be on my computer. The ability to post from my phone is the secret sauce in my opinion.</li>
<li>Siteleaf is just an API. I was able to easily convert my Jekyll posts to Siteleaf with a <a href="https://gist.github.com/asimpson/9255595">simple Ruby script</a>. I can just as easily switch to another platform in the future. </li>
</ol>

<p>I'm excited by the move, I also took the opportunity to freshen the design up around here too. Hopefully you'll see more posts, more regularly.</p>
