I've moved this blog from Jekyll on Heroku to [Siteleaf](http://www.siteleaf.com/) on S3. I did this for a couple reasons:

1.  Siteleaf gives me more control without having to be on my computer. The ability to post from my phone is the secret sauce in my opinion.
2.  Siteleaf is just an API. I was able to easily convert my Jekyll posts to Siteleaf with a [simple Ruby script](https://gist.github.com/asimpson/9255595). I can just as easily switch to another platform in the future.

I'm excited by the move, I also took the opportunity to freshen the design up around here too. Hopefully you'll see more posts, more regularly.
