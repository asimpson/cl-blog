From [Benedict Evan's weekly newsletter](http://mailchi.mp/ben-evans/benedicts-newsletter-no-450333?e=c97fd3b467) on the new screenshot features in iOS11:

> Finally, screenshots. It's pretty clear that smartphone screenshots are the new PDF - a universal data exchange format.

:facepalm: We really couldn't have picked a worse data exchange format.

\-1000 internets everybody.

  - How do machines reliably parse screenshot information?

\-100 more internets after I've thought about it some more.
