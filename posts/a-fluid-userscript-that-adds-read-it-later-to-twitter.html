<p>I use and love <a href="http://craigmod.com/">Craig Mod's</a> <a href="http://craigmod.com/satellite/twitter_for_minimalists/">Twitter for Minimalists</a>. It is a great way to experience the Twitter web client without some of the cruft. However, the biggest thing I miss from third party apps like Tweetbot is the ability to send interesting links directly to my Instapaper account with one click.</p>

<p>Since Twitter for Minimalists runs inside a <a href="http://fluidapp.com/">Fluid</a> instance I can set custom Userstyles (like Twitter for Minimalists) and Userscripts. I decided to write a Userscript that would parse through every tweet and determine if it had a link and - if it did - append a Send to Instapaper button to the bottom of the tweet. I was able to create the button using <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/publishers">Instapaper's iFrame Button API</a>. You can find the the finished code for the Read it Later Userscript <a href="https://github.com/asimpson/send-to-instapaper-fluid">here</a>.</p>

<p>Hope you find it useful!</p>
