[Marco](http://www.marco.org/2015/05/29/why-not-google) and [Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/05/30/why-not-google) shared last week that they both use [DuckDuckGo](http://duckduckgo.com) and [Fastmail](http://www.fastmail.com/?STKI=14274077)(referral link) instead of Google search and Gmail. Since I just started using both services, here are a few of my thoughts on them.

I previously had Google Apps set up for my domain email (adam@adamsimpson.net). By far the best thing I can say about Fastmail is that I haven't noticed anything different since switching. Fastmail's spam protection, speed, and reliability all seem on par with Google's and I appreciate the superior incentives of Fastmail when it comes to privacy.

It's the same story with DuckDuckGo, I haven't noticed a drop-off in the quality of the search results. One of my favorite features is the ability to send search queries as `POST` requests instead of `GET` requests. I love this because it prevents my history from getting polluted with DuckDuckGo pages that have terms in the URL; a little thing for sure, but one I appreciate.

I was skeptical about how happy I would be with things outside of Google's ecosystem, but I've been pleasantly surprised. Fastmail and DuckDuckGo offer a great alternative to Google's apps.
