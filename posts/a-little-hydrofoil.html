<p>While taking a short break today, I flipped over to <a href="http://robin.sloan.usesthis.com/">Robin Sloan's interview on the Setup</a>. Now Mr. Sloan almost broke the Internet a few days ago with his <a href="http://www.robinsloan.com/summer-reading/and-programming/">book review in Javascript</a>. In his interview for the Setup he described how he sees himself as a programmer,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I imagine professional programmers as jumbo jets, capable of cruising smoothly and swiftly at altitude for hours, no internet needed; by contrast, I'm just a little hydrofoil kinda bumping along, held shakily aloft by the ground effect of online documentation, code snippets and tutorial blog posts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I totally identify with his analogy, and would wager most "jumbo jets" feel the same way. I think this ties into why I agree so strongly with <a href="https://twitter.com/SlexAxton/status/177127432749461504">Alex Sexton's tweet</a> from earlier this year (hat-tip to <a href="https://twitter.com/motherfuton/status/177173995840479233">Motherfuton</a> for the RT),</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think being skilled at debugging is probably more important than being skilled at coding.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Programming is problem-solving, hence my constant dips into <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stackoverflow</a> and Google. To extend Mr. Sloan's analogy a bit more, even Jumbo Jets need maintenance and fuel.</p>
