So, in the past 6 months [I've switched from Sublime Text to Vim](https://github.com/asimpson/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc).

And just like that I've fulfilled [Harry Robert's](http://twitter.com/csswizardry) tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">How do you spot a Vim user?<br><br>Oh, don’t worry, they’ll let you know.</p>&mdash; Harry Roberts (@csswizardry) <a href="https://twitter.com/csswizardry/status/481468881400528896?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 24, 2014</a></blockquote>

Whelp. Anyway, onwards and upwards I guess.

Speaking of Harry, if your looking to get started with Vim, checkout [his awesome guide that he wrote to save me the trouble of writing one myself\!](http://csswizardry.com/2014/06/vim-for-people-who-think-things-like-vim-are-weird-and-hard/)

Earlier tonight I was perusing the interwebs (shocker right?) and wound up on [Wynn Netherland's](http://wynnnetherland.com) [archives](http://wynnnetherland.com/archives), because he's an awesome dude and wicked smart. I came across a few really good Vim posts that I thought I'd highlight here:

  - [A Good Vimrc](http://dougblack.io/words/a-good-vimrc.html)
  - [Vim anti-patterns](http://blog.sanctum.geek.nz/vim-anti-patterns/)
  - [Relative line numbers in Vim](http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2012/relative-line-numbers-in-vim-for-super-fast-movement/)

I totally agree with the [anti-patterns](http://blog.sanctum.geek.nz/vim-anti-patterns/) and [vimrc](http://dougblack.io/words/a-good-vimrc.html) posts. I also need to try the [relative numbers approach](http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2012/relative-line-numbers-in-vim-for-super-fast-movement/).

To finish up this hode-podge of links and rambling, my buddy [@seanwashington](http://twitter.com/seanwashington) recently [pointed me](https://twitter.com/seanwashington/status/482247769747255297) to [vimawesome](http://vimawesome.com), and holy crap it's awesome, I highly recommend checking out the awesome plugins on that site.

Anyway, [back to your regularly scheduled internets](http://media.giphy.com/media/NO3XxB6Ny3eZq/giphy.gif).
