<p>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/avclark/status/453220061831237632">this tweet by Adam Clark</a> and <a href="http://flippinawesome.org/2014/03/31/paralyzed-by-choice-in-front-end-development/">this post by Brian Rinadli</a> I've been thinking about how I keep up with changes in the web development world.</p>

<p>Brian writes in his article that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the biggest difficulties front-end developers face can be deciding what is worth paying attention to and what isn’t. If you follow social media, Hacker News, EchoJS or even a handful of blogs, it can be hard to decipher the tools or frameworks that are deserving of investigation versus those that maybe just aren’t there yet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree; there's good signal in those streams. However, it's incresingly difficult to parse the good stuff from the link bait. Brian shares a great list of email newsletters that aim to help cull the noise into manageable chunks of information. I subscribe to <a href="http://web-design-weekly.com/">Web Design Weekly</a> and <a href="http://tinyletter.com/wdrl">Web Development Reading List</a>. I probably only click on 3-4 links in each one, but this approach has worked really well for me for quite some time.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/avclark/status/453220061831237632">Adam expressed</a> another angle to this issue:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I can’t keep up with my twitter feeds, but everyone I follow is valuable to me. Do I trim down or stop worrying about <em>keeping up</em>?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Personally, I gave up trying to read my entire feed a while ago; it isn't feasible. I also try to be selective about how many folks I follow. The harsh reality is that eventually you won't be able to keep up. I recommend <a href="http://www.news.me/">News.Me</a> which emails you the top couple links that were shared in your twitter feed the previous day.</p>

<p>I also highly recommend <a href="https://pinboard.in/popular/">Pinboard's popular page</a>. While not specifically related to web development, I always find a good link or two  perusing it every few days.</p>

<p>These tools allow me to relax. Keeping up with the web industry is tough, but this approach nicely limits my twitter check-ins to once or twice a day during the week.</p>
