<p><a href="http://www.manton.org">Manton Reece</a> recently shared <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/microblogging-with-wordpress.html">his microblogging setup</a> with WordPress. I have a similar system that was inspired by <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/6826">Jeremy Keith's example</a>. Like Manton, I had to figure out the quickest way to create a new post. I eventually settled on SMS-to-post thanks (<a href="http://adamsimpson.net/writing/iphone-checker-with-capybara-and-twilio">once again</a>) to <a href="http://twilio.com">Twilio</a>. SMS-to-post lets me text my Twilio number which sends the text to WordPress where it becomes a new "note". Publishing that "note" to Twitter is just a matter of hooking into the WordPress <code>publish_post</code> action and sending the post to Twitter via its API.</p>

<p>Here are a few other implementation notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>I created a custom post type in WordPress called "Notes". </li>
<li>The <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Status_Transitions">post status API</a> makes this entire process smooth.</li>
<li>SMS-to-post has a few gotchas, the biggest one is that <a href="https://www.twilio.com/help/faq/sms/why-are-my-messages-with-unicode-being-split">SMS with emoji are limited to 70 characters</a>.</li>
<li>I don't have an RSS feed for my Notes...yet</li>
<li>I save the tweet ID of every post that gets posted to Twitter. I use that ID to pull in the favorite and retweet counts and display them next to each "note" in the WordPress dashboard.</li>
<li>Twilio needs an endpoint to POST incoming texts to WordPress. Creating custom endpoints is trivial thanks to <a href="http://coderrr.com/create-an-api-endpoint-in-wordpress/">this great guide</a>. I also recommend <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/rewrite-rules-inspector/">the rewrite rules inspector plugin</a> for working with rewrite rules.</li>
</ul>
