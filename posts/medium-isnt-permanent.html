<p>Owen Williams just realized <a href="http://click.mlsend3.com/link/c/YT04OTYxNDcyODIxNTg2ODgwNjEmYz16MHI1JmU9NTQxNjU3ODAmYj0xNzcxOTA5NTgmZD1tMGIxZzV2.Ih4lJDXWFC2yKp4Olw8dx-J27KB9xaWDs5hLKy6GX04">Medium isn&#39;t a permanent fixture on the Internet</a>:</p>

<p>It&#39;s not difficult to imagine an acquisition on the horizon (by who, one would wonder) or some other sort of exit. It doesn&#39;t feel like Medium has a strategy, living on borrowed time and money; what happens if this beautiful, simple central store of content just disappears?</p>

<p>No offense to Owen but this has been Medium&#39;s problem from day one. If you&#39;re writing on the Internet and you aren&#39;t hosting (owning) your content you&#39;re work <em>will</em> disappear; it&#39;s just a matter of time.</p>
<p>Owning your content is why <a href="https://micro.blog">micro.blog</a> is so interesting to me. 
Owning your content is why RSS is never going away.
Owning your content is why things like Wordpress, Moveable Type, and the <a href="https://jamstack.org">JAM stack</a> are much better choices than yet another online service.</p>
