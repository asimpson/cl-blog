Today I turn 30. For the last couple birthdays I've wanted to do a "X things I've learned" post like the incomparable [Mr. Noah Stokes](http://esbueno.noahstokes.com/post/155722679971/forty) but I kept forgetting. Not this year\! This past year has been exceptionally full. In my mind, turning 30 has always been a milestone. Turns out (*spoilers\!*) the day is just a that, a marker; all the exciting stuff is ahead and behind. I'm so thankful I get to navigate it all with a great partner in crime/life/adventure, my wife Christi üòç.

Without further ado, I present to you my list of 30 things I've learned in the past year (or so).
