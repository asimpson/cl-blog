<h2 id="taking-the-hackintosh-plunge">Taking the Hackintosh plunge</h2>
<p>I built a PC (here&#39;s the <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/list/GvNtRG">partslist</a>) in May to replace my Xbox One (yay no more Live fees!). And then last week with support for AMD GPUs in 10.12.6, I took the plunge and turned that PC into a Hackintosh. The process of getting a Hackintosh up and running wasn&#39;t really that much more difficult than setting up Arch Linux. In fact I&#39;d say you could and probably should follow most of the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/System_maintenance">Arch Linux ideals</a> about knowing what and why you&#39;re updating as you maintain a Hackintosh.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a few tips and things I learned along the way. I&#39;d also recommend reading through the tips in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/4jgdny/tips_and_tricks_youve_learnt_living_the/d36pk9f/">this reddit post</a>.</p>
<h2 id="happy-path-use-clover-">Happy Path (Use Clover)</h2>
<p>The ideal setup is to use <a href="https://clover-wiki.zetam.org/Home">Clover</a> to add <a href="http://hackintosher.com/blog/kext-files-macos/">ktext</a> and modify the <code>config.plist</code> in the <code>/EFI</code> partition. This leaves your actual macos install untouched. Avoid Unibeast and Multibeast, they try do too much and mask complexity. The truly &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; approach is outlined <a href="https://eladnava.com/install-os-x-10-11-el-capitan-on-hackintosh-vanilla/">here</a>. I ended up following a guide and using (and then modifying) their pre-made <code>/EFI</code> partition. Speaking of&#x2026;</p>
<h2 id="find-a-guide">Find a guide</h2>
<p>I combined and followed these two guides:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://hackintosher.com/guides/guide-installing-macos-kabylake-hackintosh-sierra/">http://hackintosher.com/guides/guide-installing-macos-kabylake-hackintosh-sierra/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://hackintosher.com/guides/updating-hackintosh-sierra-10-12-6/">http://hackintosher.com/guides/updating-hackintosh-sierra-10-12-6/</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="keep-it-simple">Keep it simple</h2>
<p>Solve one thing at a time. Google error messages.</p>
<h2 id="use-compatible-parts">Use compatible parts</h2>
<ul>
<li>I&#39;d recommend an Intel KabyLake CPU since it&#39;s the latest and greatest and it means you&#39;ll need a 200 series motherboard which is recommended anyway. AMD CPUs are not really supported.</li>
<li>While my build uses the Pentium G4560 I wouldn&#39;t recommend it as a great Hackintosh CPU. It works, but things would be smoother with an i5 or i7.</li>
<li>AMD GPUs (if you can find one at a decent price, damn you <a href="https://www.ethereum.org">Etherium</a>) have great native support now in 10.12.6, e.g. Metal Support!</li>
<li>Grab a WiFi/Bluetooth card from <a href="http://www.osxwifi.com">osxwifi.com</a>, genuine Apple parts which means things just work (I&#39;m content with no Bluetooth and Ethernet for now)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="one-os-per-drive">One OS per drive</h2>
<p>Don&#39;t try to partition a drive and install macos and Windows on it. Keep all operating systems on their own boot drives and then boot into them using Clover.</p>
<h2 id="disable-hibernation-if-you-re-on-a-pentium">Disable hibernation if you&#39;re on a Pentium</h2>
<p>You&#39;ll need to set two power management switches:</p>
<p><code>sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0</code></p>
<p><code>sudo pmset -a standby 0</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>To disable hibernation images completely, ensure hibernatemode standby and autopoweroff are all set to 0.
~ pmset man page</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I didn&#39;t run into issues with <code>autopoweroff</code>.</p>
<h2 id="disable-automatic-updates-">Disable automatic updates.</h2>
<p>You can still update through the App Store but it&#39;s advised to wait and see if any ktexts or plist changes are needed before updating</p>
<p>That&#39;s it. Hopefully this post helps clarify the process to create a Hackintosh of your own.</p>
