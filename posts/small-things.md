Recently I've come to love [MicroJS](http://microjs.com). I love that I can find tiny, specific libraries that do one thing, and do it well. I think my affection for MicroJS is fueled by my [current fascination](/writing/learning-to-think-in-react), [React](http://reactjs.com). React bills itself as:

> A Javascript library for building user interfaces.

I think this focus on building user interfaces pushes me to seek out complimentary tools that focus on solving singular problems. React's narrowly-defined API and reliance on Javascript's primitives leaves lots of space for me to cobble together the stack that best solves the current problem(s).

As I've thought about this more, I've realized just how powerful a framework's aspirations can be. They trickle in and bend my perspective when I use them. It is a small thing that developers, myself included, often overlook.
