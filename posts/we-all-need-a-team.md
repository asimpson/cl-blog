[Bill Simmons'](https://twitter.com/BillSimmons) latest piece [on Pat Riley](https://theringer.com/pat-riley-gets-what-he-wants-undeniables-bill-simmons-4064cf607e42) is full of great Riley stories. One particular moment where Riley talks to Kevin Garnett really resonated with me (italics mine):

> It happened to everyone. *You won’t truly know how outstanding you are, Riley promised him, until you’re surrounded by elite teammates who make you better.* He told stories about Magic’s Lakers teams, how special they were, how many battles they fought, how those postseasons bonded them for life. There was a higher level of basketball. It was out there. You wouldn’t understand until you’ve experienced it. And until you’ve lost it, too.

We all need a team. On the *right* team we can go higher and be better than we ever thought we could.

To put it another way, we can only go so far alone.
