<p>I&#39;m currently sitting on an airplane headed to Grapevine, Texas for <a href="http://circlesconference.com">Circles Conf</a>. Circles Conf is a design conference that I&#39;ve kept an eye on for the last couple years. I specifically chose this conference because it wasn&#39;t a development conference. As a frontend developer, I think it&#39;s important to be well-rounded in all aspects of the frontend and that includes design. I feel like the last couple years I&#39;ve invested deeply in Javascript and all the incredible ways frontend code is changing. However, I think it&#39;s time to work out a different set of muscles. So, I&#39;m headed to a design conference as a frontend developer and I don&#39;t see a single talk about &quot;Slack bots with Node&quot; (or something about &quot;Serverless and React&quot;) on the schedule and I&#39;m super pumped.</p>
<h2 id="expectations">Expectations</h2>
<p>I thought I&#39;d list out a few of the talks I&#39;m looking forward to and what I hope to come away with. I think the entire lineup looks great but there are a few TBA slots with no title so I have no idea what to think about those. I&#39;m hoping to review this post after the conference and use it as a kind of guide to digest everything that happened.</p>
<h3 id="panels">Panels</h3>
<p>I have no idea what to expect from the scheduled Panels. There is one each day maybe this will be some solid Q/A or good round-table discussion?</p>
<h3 id="dan-rubin">Dan Rubin</h3>
<p>I&#39;m excited to hear <a href="https://instagram.com/danrubin">Dan Rubin</a>. I&#39;ve followed Dan on Twitter and Instagram for some time but I&#39;ve never heard him speak.</p>
<h3 id="ash-huang">Ash Huang</h3>
<p>I&#39;ve never heard of <a href="http://ashsmash.com/">Ash</a> until I saw the speaker line-up, but she&#39;s seems like a prolific writer and deep thinker. Her talk is called &quot;Design was supposed to be The Answer&quot; and I can&#39;t wait to hear it. I also think there is a talk called &quot;Javascript was supposed to be The Answer&quot; just waiting to be written.</p>
<h3 id="jay-argaet">Jay Argaet</h3>
<p>I&#39;m a fan of <a href="https://hillsong.com/united/">Hillsong&#39;s music</a> along with their branding and art direction. I&#39;m curious to hear what <a href="http://hillsong.com/contributor/jay-argaet/">Jay</a> has to say about &quot;Unlocking Creativity&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="annette-neu">Annette Neu</h3>
<p>The topic for <a href="http://handsome.is/">Annette&#39;s</a> talk resonates with me. I often feel unsure how to begin on a problem that has lots of uncertainty surrounding it. I&#39;m confident this will apply to <em>all</em> creative disciplines (e.g. development as well as design).</p>
<h2 id="here-we-go">Here we go</h2>
<p>So there you have it. My scant expectations on what I&#39;m looking forward to at Circles Conf. If you&#39;re attending Circles don&#39;t hesitate to say hi (or hit me up on <a href="https://twitter.com/a_simpson">twitter</a>) and get a swanky <a href="https://seesparkbox.com">Sparkbox</a> business card!</p>
