<p>I've been on a <a href="https://github.com/asimpson/espn-scraper-to-rss">web scraping tear lately</a>. So, I thought I'd compile what I've learned and put together a repo as a howto/cookbook/guide thing. So, here it is: introducing <a href="https://github.com/asimpson/nodejs-web-scraper-cookbook">the Node web scraper cookbook</a>.</p>

<p>I hope it's useful. It's nice to have this stuff written down just for my own sake. If you find it useful, awful, or confusing feel free to create an issue on the repo and I'll try to update things.</p>
