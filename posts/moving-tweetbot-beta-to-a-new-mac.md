Tweetbot for Mac entered Beta a few weeks ago, and also cut off new users from trying out the Beta to comply with new [API changes from Twitter](/maybe-you-should-its-not-you-move-on).

I love Tweetbot, and the Mac client is no exception. However I ran into a snag when I tried to set up the Tweetbot Beta on my new MacBook Air. The app kept redirecting me to the [Tweetbot Beta blog post](tapbots.com/blog/news/tweetbot-for-mac-beta-sort-of). Now to be fair, I think if I had used the Migration Assistant built into OS X I wouldn't have run into this issue. However I had already decided to "start fresh" on this new machine and only bring things over from my old MacBook Pro when needed. After spending a couple minutes Googling around for a solution, I gave up and reverted to my trusty, stand-by [Twitterific](http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific).

After a couple days of this I got the bug again to see if I could get Tweetbot Beta up and running on my new machine. New comments on the Tweetbot Beta blog post revealed the solution. Check out these [two](http://tapbots.com/blog/news/tweetbot-for-mac-beta-sort-of#comment-3609) [answers](http://tapbots.com/blog/news/tweetbot-for-mac-beta-sort-of#comment-3605), Tweetbot Beta is now happily running on my new MacBook Air. To move Tweetbot Beta to a new machine copy the **Tweetbot Keychain item, Application Support folder, and Container folder** to your new Mac and you should be good to go.
