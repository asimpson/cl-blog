Currently, I have the cheapest [Kindle](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1000750701&tag=googhydr-20&hvadid=19552942650&hvpos=1t1&hvexid=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=488712776137896327&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=e&ref=pd_sl_9h7vyrl94n_e) you can buy and I love it. I love it for reasons entirely different from my iPad. I love this Kindle cause it's super cheap and durable, and I never worry about its battery life or wether it's getting smashed in a bag when I travel.

I also love this Kindle for reading. I set up my [Instapaper](http://www.instapaper.com/) account to send me a digest of my Unread list every weekend, perfect for traveling, the pool, or even the beach â€“ you know, places the iPad shouldn't and can't go. The Kindle feature in Instapaper got me excited about other possibilities for reading web stuffs on my Kindle.

The first thing I stumbled upon shortly after setting up my Instapaper to Kindle connection was [Readlists](http://readlists.com). Readlists are brought to you by the same folks behind [Readability](http://www.readability.com). Readlists allows you to cobble together a list of articles from all over the web that they then compile into a Kindle digest. Rad\!

After I discovered Readlists, I started finding [several](http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/) [fantastic](http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html) guides or books on JavaScript and Javascript best practices. Prominent members of the developer community are releasing these materials for free via Github or personal sites. I wanted to convert these excellent resources into documents on my Kindle. It was then that I discovered another fantastic resource from the Readability folks.

Readability released a [simple bookmarklet](http://www.readability.com/bookmarklets/) that takes whatever page you're viewing in your browser and sends it to your Kindle. Problem solved\! I now have a couple Kindle "books" that are sourced from the web, how awesome is that? Try it out for yourself and start utilizing the incredible resources out there.
