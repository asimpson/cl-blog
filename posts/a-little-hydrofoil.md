While taking a short break today, I flipped over to [Robin Sloan's interview on the Setup](http://robin.sloan.usesthis.com/). Now Mr. Sloan almost broke the Internet a few days ago with his [book review in Javascript](http://www.robinsloan.com/summer-reading/and-programming/). In his interview for the Setup he described how he sees himself as a programmer,

> I imagine professional programmers as jumbo jets, capable of cruising smoothly and swiftly at altitude for hours, no internet needed; by contrast, I'm just a little hydrofoil kinda bumping along, held shakily aloft by the ground effect of online documentation, code snippets and tutorial blog posts.

I totally identify with his analogy, and would wager most "jumbo jets" feel the same way. I think this ties into why I agree so strongly with [Alex Sexton's tweet](https://twitter.com/SlexAxton/status/177127432749461504) from earlier this year (hat-tip to [Motherfuton](https://twitter.com/motherfuton/status/177173995840479233) for the RT),

Programming is problem-solving, hence my constant dips into [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) and Google. To extend Mr. Sloan's analogy a bit more, even Jumbo Jets need maintenance and fuel.
