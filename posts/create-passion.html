<p>I'm slowly working my way through the latest edition of <a href="http://alwaysreadthemanual.com">The Manual Vol. #3</a>. I just finished <a href="http://tiffanijonesbrown.com">Tiffani Jones Brown's</a> excellent essay on Practicing Passion. This quote really stuck with me,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Instead of asking "what will make me feel passion?" we should ask, "how can I make passion happen?" The answer is to cultivate a way of living and working that makes passion more likely.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I love this, it doesn't leave room for me to have any excuses. Cultivation takes effort, perseverance, hard work, and purpose. Time to <a href="http://adamsimpson.net/writing/someone-is-working-harder-than-you">get to work</a>, the passion will show up if I do.</p>
