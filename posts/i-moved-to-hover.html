<p>In case you didn't hear, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/10/godaddy-outage-takes-down-millions-of-sites/">Anonymous broke GoDaddy today</a>. I figured now would be as good a time as any to explain why I moved away from GoDaddy a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>I chose <a href="https://www.hover.com/">Hover</a> to be my GoDaddy replacement. I've never hosted anything through GoDaddy (I'm not a crazy person), but I did manage all my domain names through them. <a href="https://www.hover.com/">Hover</a> and GoDaddy could not be more different, GoDaddy's interface is comedically awful, Hover's interface is relatively simple and light - two words you never, ever hear about GoDaddy's administrative panels. I figure that 90% of using a DNS service is spent in front of their admin interface, it counts to have a good one.</p>

<p>I would highly recommend switching from GoDaddy to <a href="https://www.hover.com/">Hover</a>, or <a href="http://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a>, or <a href="https://dnsimple.com/">DNS Simple</a>, the point is to switch <em>away from</em> GoDaddy not really where you switch to. So take the leap, and stop feeling sad inside when you hear another joke about GoDaddy.</p>
