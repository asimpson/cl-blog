<p>Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-battery-and-performance/">released a statement</a> on the battery and performance issues. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apple is reducing the price of an out-of-warranty iPhone battery replacement by $50 — from $79 to $29 — for anyone with an iPhone 6 or later whose battery needs to be replaced, starting in late January and available worldwide through December 2018. Details will be provided soon on apple.com.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the penalty for not being clear with users. How and why did Apple make this so opaque? It continues to baffle me. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Early in 2018, we will issue an iOS software update with new features that give users more visibility into the health of their iPhone’s battery, so they can see for themselves if its condition is affecting performance</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is what should have been in iOS when the processor management feature was released. </p>
