I appreciate [Rotten Tomatoes](http://rottentomatoes.com), I don't always agree with the ratings, but I like how they can add to an argument or conversation about a movie.

I hate the Rotten Tomatoes experience on an iPhone. It starts with this horrible app pop-up: ![Rotten Tomatoes Nag](/images/rotten-tomatoes-nag.png)

Then it nags you to add the site to your homescreen, my home screen is meticulously planned out and I don't have the room for non-apps, so Rotten Tomatoes can go kick rocks.

A month or so ago I decided to do something about these things that bug me about Rotten Tomatoes. I spent an hour or two poking around the [API](http://developer.rottentomatoes.com) and cobbled together [Diet Rotten Tomatoes](https://github.com/asimpson/Diet-Rotten-Tomatoes). It's a quick, lightweight way to get a movie's ratings, a full-size movie poster (click the thumbnail), and a link to the movie on Rotten Tomatoes.

I also added a way to search using [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com) or [Launch Center Pro](http://appcubby.com/launch-center/). Simple append your search term to the URL like `#die hard` and it'll fire off a search as the page loads.

Hopefully you find it useful.
