<p>Glenn Fleishman (<a href="https://twitter.com/GlennF">@GlennF</a>) recently linked to a method for generating <em>passphrases</em> called <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diceware">Diceware</a>. </p>

<p>Being a fan of dice (d20 for life) I thought this was super cool and worth sharing. </p>
<p>The basic premise is (to quote <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diceware">Wikipedia</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Diceware is a method for creating passphrases, passwords, and other cryptographic variables using ordinary dice as a hardware random number generator. For each word in the passphrase, five rolls of the dice are required. The numbers from 1 to 6 that come up in the rolls are assembled as a five-digit number, e.g. 43146. That number is then used to look up a word in a word list. In the English list 43146 corresponds to munch. By generating several words in sequence, a lengthy passphrase can be constructed.</p>

<p>I dig this, it&#39;s an analog solution to a digital problem. The incredible folks at the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">EFF</a> have a <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/new-wordlists-random-passphrases">couple wordlists</a> to get you started. Happy rolling! ðŸŽ² </p>
