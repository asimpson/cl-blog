<p>Recently I've come to love <a href="http://microjs.com">MicroJS</a>. I love that I can find tiny, specific libraries that do one thing, and do it well. I think my affection for MicroJS is fueled by my <a href="/writing/learning-to-think-in-react">current fascination</a>, <a href="http://reactjs.com">React</a>. React bills itself as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A Javascript library for building user interfaces.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this focus on building user interfaces pushes me to seek out complimentary tools that focus on solving singular problems. React's narrowly-defined API and reliance on Javascript's primitives leaves lots of space for me to cobble together the stack that best solves the current problem(s).</p>

<p>As I've thought about this more, I've realized just how powerful a framework's aspirations can be. They trickle in and bend my perspective when I use them. It is a small thing that developers, myself included, often overlook.</p>
