<p>I'm proud, nervous, and a little surprised that adamsimpson.net is finally live! It has been a long time in the making, and I'm relieved to have it up. Now the fun begins.</p>

<h3>A Little About Me</h3>

<p>To sum me up, I'll bust out the 'ol bullet points.</p>

<ul>
<li>I work for a <a href="http://www.fewloosescrews.com">small web shop</a>, based in Pennsylvania (though I live in Ohio) and do anything from front-end development and design to "social media" and copy-writing. </li>
<li>I am twenty-five years old and married to the greatest gal there is. </li>
<li>I graduated from <a href="http://www.cedarville.edu">college</a> with a degree in English Lit (the web is made of words, so this works, right? right?). </li>
<li>I love: the interwebs, design, development, David Foster Wallace, C.S. Lewis, Don DeLillo, and Jimmy Eat World. </li>
<li>I dislike: most vegetables, Windows (not the ones in buildings), Jane Austen, bad drivers, and when the blinds in our apartment are open at night, it just skeeves me out.</li>
</ul>

<h3>About This Site</h3>

<p>Still here uh? Brave. Very brave. You have leveled up +1 in patience.</p>

<p>Anyway, my vision for this site is a place where I can share the things I'm learning as I do my job, so lots of nerdy posts about front-end development stuff, design stuff, and writing stuff. I'll probably also throw in observations on the latest tech gadgetry. I may also do more general posts regarding general creative work or whatever else strikes my fancy.</p>

<h3>Technical Bits</h3>

<p>This site is powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, a static-site generator. Jekyll is fantastic for a number of reasons, but I love it because I give it text files, and it gives me my site.</p>

<p>I've modified my Jekyll install a bit. I added <a href="https://github.com/azsromej/jekyll/commit/4b039b2804bc34382add7462f4e0f47c255e2151">Steven Romej's permalink changes</a> to stop Jekyll from creating 'post-name-as-a-folder->index.html' to 'post-name-as-a-file.html'. I also adopted the pagination changes from <a href="https://github.com/daneharrigan/jekyll">Dane Harrigan's fork</a>.</p>

<p>Jekyll is running on top of a <a href="http://www.linode.com/?r=a4bf52b7804eb5bb3add85d3caeeee5f1d84cf67">Linode 512</a> running Unbuntu and <a href="http://nginx.com/">Nginx</a>. I added one line to my Nginx conf file to support better permalinks thanks to <a href="http://www.allampersandall.com/2012/06/nginx-rewrite-remove-html">this great post</a>. I just used the one line, <code>try_files  $uri.html  $uri/ 404.html;</code>.</p>

<p>My posting process is simple and straightforward, all I need is Dropbox and a text editor. Usually this means I am using <a href="http://www.iawriter.com/">iA Writer</a>, which happily melds the two requirements (and works on my iPhone, iPad, or Mac). I simply write a post and save it in my posts folder in Dropbox. Dropbox takes care of syncing it to the Linode which has Dropbox and a shared copy of my site folder. When a new post is synced up, Jekyll builds my site with the new data and it's done, the post is live.</p>

<p>Now I owe <a href="http://tedkulp.com/2011/05/22/automating-jekyll-builds/">Ted Kulp</a> and <a href="http://clickontyler.com/blog/2011/11/publishing-your-blog-with-dropbox-and-jekyll/">Tyler Hall</a> a beer for their posts that got me going with this Dropbox to Jekyll setup. I followed Mr. Kulp's idea and had <a href="http://inotify.aiken.cz/?section=incron&amp;page=doc&amp;lang=en">incron</a> fire a little bash script when a new post came in from Dropbox.</p>

<p>The other obvious benefit to having my site in Dropbox is that my site is automatically backed up.</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>

<p>And now, the infamous, what-do-I-use-at-my-desk section.</p>

<p>Well, I currently use a 15" MacBook Pro circa 2009. I connect it to an old 20" Dell LCD at my desk, and also use a Apple Wireless Keyboard, and Magic Mouse.</p>

<p>I also have an iPhone 4, iPad 2, and a Kindle.</p>

<p>Overall, I'm happy with my current setup, though I do plan on picking up an SSD + 8GB of RAM in the near future.</p>

<h3>Software</h3>

<p>As I already mentioned, I use <a href="http://www.iawriter.com/">iA Writer</a> to write this site, and also for any writing needs for work. I also use <a href="http://simplenoteapp.com/">Simplenote</a> &amp; <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/project/nvalt/">NValt</a> for quick thoughts and to-do lists on the go.</p>

<p>I use Fireworks and Photoshop for any design related work. I use a combination of <a href="http://panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a> and <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text 2</a> for my FTPing and coding needs. Terminal is usually open for Git, or server tomfoolery.</p>

<p>Finally, for my browsers I use Safari &amp; <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/chromesxs">Chrome Canary</a> for browsing and development respectively.</p>

<h3>The End</h3>

<p>I hope this wall of text isn't too intimidating and that you learned a little bit about me and what makes this site tick. Just a word of warning, the look and feel of this site may change from time to time. I love to tinker, so consider it a constant work in progress. Thanks for reading.</p>

<p>Stick around and enjoy the ride with me!</p>

<p>-Adam</p>
