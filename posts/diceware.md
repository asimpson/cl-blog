Glenn Fleishman ([@GlennF](https://twitter.com/GlennF)) recently linked to a method for generating *passphrases* called [Diceware](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diceware).

Being a fan of dice (d20 for life) I thought this was super cool and worth sharing.

The basic premise is (to quote [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diceware)):

> Diceware is a method for creating passphrases, passwords, and other cryptographic variables using ordinary dice as a hardware random number generator. For each word in the passphrase, five rolls of the dice are required. The numbers from 1 to 6 that come up in the rolls are assembled as a five-digit number, e.g. 43146. That number is then used to look up a word in a word list. In the English list 43146 corresponds to munch. By generating several words in sequence, a lengthy passphrase can be constructed.

I dig this, it's an analog solution to a digital problem. The incredible folks at the [EFF](https://www.eff.org/) have a [couple wordlists](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/new-wordlists-random-passphrases) to get you started. Happy rolling\! ðŸŽ²
