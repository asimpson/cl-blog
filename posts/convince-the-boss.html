<p>Speaking of <a href="http://adamsimpson.net/writing/create-passion">cultivation and passion</a>, Jeremy Keith wrote up a <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/5634/">great post</a> on how to convince one's boss or client to adopt new web standards or methods.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I do sometimes wonder whether we use the big bad client or the big bad boss as a crutch. “Oh, I’d love to try out this technique, but the client/boss would never go for it. Something something IE6.” Maybe we’re not giving them enough credit. Given the right argument, they might just listen to reason.</p>

<p>Go <em>work</em> on getting the right arguments for your specific client or boss, go <em>cultivate</em> a metric-ton of data to overwhelm whoever is holding back progress. No one is going to reach out and whack your boss or client with a "Web Standards Genius" stick for you, do the whacking yourself (figuratively, I do not endorse or condone violence against one's superiors, peers, or underlings). If after all that effort you're still not getting anywhere, then follow Mr. Keith's other piece of advice:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Another tactic that I’ve used in the past is to simply not ask for permission, but go ahead and use the new technologies and techniques anyway.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Go do.</p>
