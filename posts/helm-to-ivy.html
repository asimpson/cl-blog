<p>I started playing around with <a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper">Ivy</a> earlier today. I was motivated in part by reading through the author&#39;s blog, <a href="http://oremacs.com">oremacs</a>. I also love his swiper plugin and figured I had to give Ivy a try.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>For the record I discovered <a href="https://github.com/emacs-helm">Helm</a> about 20 minutes into my initial foray into emacs. I ‚ù§ Helm. I support the project on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/emacshelm">Patreon</a>. It&#39;s great. I&#39;m all about mastering my tools though and to do that I need to at least try other tools. Enter my attempt to switch to Ivy.</p>
<h2 id="progress">Progress</h2>
<p>This post isn&#39;t meant to be a finished product. I&#39;m going to try and circle back occasionally as I use Ivy for the next couple days. A few notes on my experience so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>I somehow had an old version of Ivy installed and when I went to install counsel I was getting weird errors. Deleting Ivy from my <code>elpa</code> directory manually cleared things up.</li>
<li>Wow, by default, Ivy feels much more sparse than Helm. The first thing I had to do was figure out the &quot;buffers list&quot; implementation and change my <code>C-=</code> binding from helm to ivy. It&#39;s definitely more spartan, but I don&#39;t <em>think</em> its a negative necessarily just a change.</li>
<li>Ivy is just a completion package, by itself it doesn&#39;t do a ton. That&#39;s why it comes with <code>counsel</code> and <code>swiper</code> these are the primary interfaces to the good stuff, e.g. <code>counsel-ag</code> searches your project with <a href="https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher">Silver Searcher</a>.</li>
<li>Previews are incredible! Thanks to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/51lqn9/helm_or_ivy/d7d4420/">this comment</a> on reddit. With the <code>C-M-n</code> and <code>C-M-p</code> commands you cycle through any matches and you see the entire file in the buffer. Imagine searching for a keyword in a project and then getting to see all the glorious context as you pick through the matches without having to open every single file!</li>
<li><del>Not sure how to completely prevent a package from loading. I don&#39;t want <code>helm</code> to load while I play with Ivy. The <code>:disabled:</code> keyword in use-package doesn&#39;t really prevent it from being loaded, it just prevents the <code>use-package</code> form from being executed. I ended up relying on <code>git</code> and removed the lines from my .emacs and I <code>rm -rf</code> the helm package directories.</del> I looked at this again after sleeping on it. I defined two variables <code>simpson-evil</code> and <code>simpson-helm</code> and I check those values in my config to set up configurations depending on which packages is available. Easy enough.</li>
<li>I had a epiphany about how <code>use-package</code> works. <code>use-package</code> will auto load any package that has a <code>:bind</code>, <code>:mode</code>, <code>:command</code>, or <code>:init</code> keyword. If all you have is <code>:config</code> that package won&#39;t load itself. However adding <code>:defer 1</code> will load that package once emacs is idle for a second and then fire off the <code>:config</code> body. So far so good. <code>:disabled</code> comes into play even if you have a <code>:after</code> keyword because if you have <code>:after</code> combined with any of the &quot;auto load&quot; keywords above the package will try to do stuff.</li>
</ul>
