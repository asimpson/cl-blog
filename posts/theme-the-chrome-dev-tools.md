Let me start by explaining that the Chrome Developer Tools are incredible, and that I consider them essential to doing my job. What I did not know about these awesome tools is that they are essentially a web app; an app that I can tweak, change, and even inspect with itself.

Last week, I stumbled across [this post](http://darcyclarke.me/design/skin-your-chrome-inspector/) by Mr. Clarke where he explains how to theme the Dev Tools using a single CSS file. This blew my mind and led to a fury of Googling for different themes. I eventually found the exact same theme I use in Sublime, only for the Dev Tools. [The Tomorrow Theme for Chrome by Ben Truyman](https://gist.github.com/1163300) was almost perfect, I made a few slight modifications to it and posted my own gist [here](https://gist.github.com/3841278).

Some of you may be wondering, "Wait, how did you make modifications? Guesswork?". Nope. Paul Irish [explains in this thread](http://paulirish.com/2011/a-re-introduction-to-the-chrome-developer-tools/#comment-82042) how to inspect the Dev Toolsâ€¦using the Dev Tools\! With this little hint, you can easily tweak or completely theme the Chrome Dev Tools.

I hope this post was helpful to someone who was unaware of all this functionality a mere stylesheet away.
