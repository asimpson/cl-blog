  <p>Before a technologist writes a line of code, or a marketer writes a line of copy, or a designer creates a single wireframe or design, you have to establish the story that your product is going to tell.</p>

<p>Story is essential for many things, beyond just products. Stories are how we as humans define our memories and explain our world.</p>

<p>A product without a good story - a story that explains where something came from and where it is going - inspires apathy and disinterest.</p>

<p>Stories not only affect the consumer and the success of the product, they also affect the people working on the product. If you are feeling "disinterested" or "unmotivated" in your work, examine the story behind your work or product.</p>
