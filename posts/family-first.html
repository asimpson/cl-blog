<p><a href="http://chrisbowler.com/">Chris Bowler</a> jots down some fantastic advice in his <a href="http://chrisbowler.com/journal/overcoming-project-guilt">latest post</a> (emphasis mine).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But my purpose here is to simply encourage those with families. <strong>Please do not spend your time endlessly comparing your accomplishments or progress</strong> with those who have no family. Your setting yourself up for guilt at best, and resenting your family at worst.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do not have any kids yet but I think this advice applies to everyone, especially those working on the web. I've been slowly learning that I cannot continue to compare myself to other people in my industry - it's counterproductive.</p>
